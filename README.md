# nPhoneKIT

**nPhoneKIT** is a fully open-source, community-powered toolbox for Android devices ‚Äî built to replace bloated, sketchy, and closed-source tools that *hide* what they‚Äôre doing to your phone.

Unlike some other tools üëÄ that are obfuscated, flagged by antivirus scanners, and hide everything behind cryptic buttons, **nPhoneKIT** is:

- ‚úÖ 100% open Python code
- ‚úÖ Actually shows you the commands
- ‚úÖ Doesn‚Äôt ping weird servers or drop mystery EXEs in Temp folders
- ‚úÖ Does most of the things that other tools can do anyway

### Why choose a tool that *won‚Äôt* tell you what it‚Äôs doing?
With **nPhoneKIT**, there‚Äôs no "magic click" ‚Äì just real commands, real transparency, and zero smoke and mirrors.

---

### Bugs:
- We are currently aware of a bug that stops all actions from working when plugging in a phone. This will be fixed with the release of v3.0.0.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you find a bug, **make sure to open a GitHub issue.** This will help me fix the error and make nPhoneKIT better for everyone!

### Notes:

- nPhoneKIT has a feature called "Success Checks" which will contact external servers, telling them whether a said feature worked on your phone model. No personal data is sent. This helps improve nPhoneKIT.
