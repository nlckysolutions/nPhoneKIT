# nPhoneKIT
nPhoneKIT is a fully open source toolbox with a Tkinter GUI, performing modifications on Samsung, LG, and other Android phones, written entirely in Python.

It utilizes **AT**, **ADB**, and other USB commands in order to perform most features that are not easy to do manually.

**Unlike SAMFW TOOL**, which is **closed-source**, **obfuscated**, and gets flagged as **malicious** by **30+** antivirus programs, **nPhoneKIT** is **open-source**, **written in Python**, with **easy-to-read code**, and actually **shows you** the commands that are being executed on your phone, **easily visible** in the code!
