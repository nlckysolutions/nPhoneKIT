# nPhoneKIT

## READ THE WHOLE README FOR A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF EVERYTHING NPHONEKIT WILL/CAN DO!

**nPhoneKIT** is a fully open-source, community-powered toolbox for Android devices ‚Äî built to replace bloated, sketchy, and closed-source tools that *hide* what they‚Äôre doing to your phone.

Unlike some other tools üëÄ that are obfuscated, flagged by antivirus scanners, and hide everything behind cryptic buttons, **nPhoneKIT** is:

- ‚úÖ 100% open Python code
- ‚úÖ Actually shows you the commands
- ‚úÖ Doesn‚Äôt drop mystery EXEs in Temp folders
- ‚úÖ Does most of the things that other tools can do anyway

### Why choose a tool that *won‚Äôt* tell you what it‚Äôs doing?
With **nPhoneKIT**, there‚Äôs no "magic click" ‚Äì just real commands, real transparency, and zero smoke and mirrors.

### Bugs:
- FRP unlock buttons attempt to work but say OK and FAIL at the same time. Should be fixed in v1.3.2
- "preloaderror" variable stops nPhoneKIT from launching on Windows. Should be fixed in v1.3.2

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you find a bug, **make sure to open a GitHub issue.** This will help me fix the error and make nPhoneKIT better for everyone!

### Credits:
- **MediaTek features work only using MTKCLIENT, which is in the DEPS folder. Sourced from: https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient. MTKCLIENT is provided by bkerler and IS NOT owned or created by nPhoneKIT in ANY WAY.**
- **IMEI Checking features work by opening a new tab of www.imei.info in order to check your IMEI yourself.**

## Installation

### Windows

- Go to the latest release, download Source Code as ZIP.
- Make sure you have Python and Pip installed.
- Extract the zip, open Command Prompt as Administrator, and cd into the source code directory.
- Run the following command:
  ```
  pip install pyserial requests
  ```
- Then, (every time you want to run nPhoneKIT you will need to run this in the source folder) (before running the below command, make sure Command Prompt is started as Administrator):
  python main.py

### Linux

- Go to the latest release, download Source Code as ZIP.
- Extract the zip, open Terminal, and cd into the source code directory.
- Run the following command:
  ```
  sudo apt install python3 python3-tk python3-serial python3-requests adb
  ```
- Then, (every time you want to run nPhoneKIT you will need to run this command in the source folder) (make sure to use SUDO):
  ```
  sudo python3 main.py
  ```

  ## IMPORTANT! If you want MediaTek features on LINUX:
  - In order to enable MTKCLIENT features, please run these additional commands in the source folder which contains main.py.
    ```
    sudo python3 -m venv ./deps/venv
    sudo bash -c 'source ./deps/venv/bin/activate && pip install -r ./deps/mtkclient/requirements.txt'
    ```

    **These commands are REQUIRED on Linux in order to enable ANY MTKCLIENT features. Otherwise, MTKCLIENT simply will not open from nPhoneKIT.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:

- **nPhoneKIT has a feature called "Success Checks" which will contact external servers, telling them whether a said feature worked on your phone model. No personal data is sent. This helps improve nPhoneKIT. (You may inspect the full success check code if you would like, this is only used to improve and debug. Personal identifiers are anonymized, hashed, and made untraceable)**

|--------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
