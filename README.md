# nPhoneKIT

**nPhoneKIT** is a fully open-source, community-powered toolbox for Android devices — built to replace bloated, sketchy, and closed-source tools that *hide* what they’re doing to your phone.

Unlike some other tools 👀 that are obfuscated, flagged by antivirus scanners, and hide everything behind cryptic buttons, **nPhoneKIT** is:

- ✅ 100% open Python code
- ✅ Actually shows you the commands
- ✅ Doesn’t ping weird servers or drop mystery EXEs in Temp folders
- ✅ Does most of the things that other tools can do anyway

### Why choose a tool that *won’t* tell you what it’s doing?
With **nPhoneKIT**, there’s no "magic click" – just real commands, real transparency, and zero smoke and mirrors.
